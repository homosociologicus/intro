# intro

Hey!

My name is Michael Baytenov and I am a 3-year student at [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/) in Moscow, Russia and an aspiring data scientist studying machine learning. My major is, unsurprisingly, Economics and the minor of my choice is Psychology.
Right now I am studying Deep Learning Specialization from [deeplearning.ai](deeplearning.ai) and an algorithms course on Coursera. From time to time I also write my own programs and publish them [here](../my_projects).
I am also keen on backpacking and basketball, a fan of various series, book universes, and even some people, believe it or not!

Looking forward to the awesome world of coding!

If you have any questions or proposals, you can contact me at michaelbaytenov@gmail.com.
